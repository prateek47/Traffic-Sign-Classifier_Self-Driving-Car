## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

### Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree

#### Overview

In this project, we will use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. we will train a model so it can decode traffic signs from images. We are using the German Traffic Sign Dataset for training the model. After the model is trained, we will then test your model program on new images of traffic signs from the web, or take picture locally!!

#### Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.5 and the following Python libraries installed:

* NumPy
* SciPy
* scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* Matplotlib
* Pandas (Optional)

**We can also use python 2.7 and but first have to change the protocol of the pickled dataset to 2 in python 3.5**

I have used Python 2.7 in the above code. The above code presently consist of some errors in the Section 3 of the code.

#### Dataset

This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.

Clone the project and start the notebook.

git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Signs

cd CarND-Traffic-Signs

jupyter notebook Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb
